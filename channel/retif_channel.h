 * @date 06 Jan 2020
 * @brief IPC abstraction level for real-time-support daemon
 *
 * The module is composed of 2 parts, the channel endpoint for clients
 * (processes that require the service) and the channel endpoint for the
 * server (namely the daemon). The client channel service is called 'access'
 * while the server channel service is called 'carrier' because it realizes
 * the actual service support. Due to this choice, functions for clients are
 * prefixed with 'access' and viceversa functions for server are prefixed with
 * 'carrier'.
